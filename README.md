# BillboardSQL 🎶

This project is a SQL-based analysis of Billboard's Hot 100 and TikTok Top 50 music charts using PostgreSQL inside a Jupyter Notebook environment. It was completed as part of a review assignment to reinforce foundational database concepts and querying techniques.

## 📌 Overview

Using real-world music chart data, the project answers questions such as:
- What are the most recent top 10 hits?
- Which songs have stayed the longest on the Billboard Hot 100?
- Who are the top artists by number of weeks at rank 1?
- What songs trended simultaneously on both TikTok and Billboard?

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebooks
- PostgreSQL
- JupySQL
- Pandas
- SQL magic commands
- Billboard music chart data (Hot 100 + TikTok Top 50)
